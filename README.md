## Installation

If you'd like to self-host the bot, follow these steps:

2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/0HD/telegraf-bot/releases/latest) or clone this repository
3. Rename `example-config.json` to `config.json`.
4. Edit `config.json` and paste the bot token there.
5. Open a terminal window in the root folder of the repo.
6. Install the dependencies by entering `npm install`.
7. Enter `node index.js` to start the bot.

Once you're done, press `CTRL` + `C` in the window to stop the bot.
